# Build-CNN-Model-for-EEG-Classification
In this project, first we load dataset from three first folder of this dataset : https://physionet.org/content/chbmit/1.0.0/
data augmentation methods:
Data augmentation is a technique used to artificially increase the size of a dataset by generating new data samples from the existing ones.
Data augmentation can also be applied to vector data, such as text or numerical data. Here I used 4 different methods for this purpose including 
* Add random noise to the vector
* Multiply the vector by a random scalar
* Permute the elements of the vector
* Smoothing: This involves smoothing the original vector by applying a smoothing function such as a moving average or a Gaussian filter.
